# Gouania Phylogenomics

This repository contains all scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for the primary and downstream analyses presented in:

**_The genomics of convergent adaptation to intertidal gravel beaches in Mediterranean clingfishes_**  
Wagner *et al.* (2026), *Genome Biology and Evolution*

The code covers data processing, phylogenomic analyses, and comparative genomic workflows used in the study.

## Data availability

All raw input data and processed results required to run the notebooks are publicly available on Figshare:
